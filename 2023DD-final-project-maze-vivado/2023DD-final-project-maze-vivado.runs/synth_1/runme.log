WARNING: [Opt 31-36] Removing redundant OBUF, seg_sout_OBUF_inst, from the path connected to top-level port: seg_sout 
Resolution: The tool has removed redundant OBUF. To resolve this warning, check for redundant OBUF in the input design.
WARNING: [Opt 31-36] Removing redundant OBUF, seg_clrn_OBUF_inst, from the path connected to top-level port: seg_clrn 
Resolution: The tool has removed redundant OBUF. To resolve this warning, check for redundant OBUF in the input design.
WARNING: [Opt 31-36] Removing redundant OBUF, seg_clk_OBUF_inst, from the path connected to top-level port: seg_clk 
Resolution: The tool has removed redundant OBUF. To resolve this warning, check for redundant OBUF in the input design.
